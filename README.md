# WB_LandCoverClass
The purpose of this repository is to host the files, reports, figures and submodules of tasks 1 - 3 of the WBI project (contractor: Steve Cumming).
The main goals were: 
1) Define homogeneous subregions and their habitat and age-classes appropiate to WBP requirementes for forecasting landbird abundances. 
2) Develop and demonstrate a general method for fitting univariate categorical models (submodule bootRasterCombine)
4) Implement bivariate categorical models as SpaDES modules (submodule posthocBinnig)

The final report for goal #1 in its different versions, can be found in the files: WB_LandCoverClasses.rmd, WB_LandCoverClasses.html ,and WB_LandCoverClasses.pdf. 
The SpaDES submodule WBI_vegReclass (modules/WBI_vegReclass) is a classifier that has been implemented for BCR 6 in Alberta and British Columbia.
The outputs of this module (forested types and ages) will be used as an input for Deliverable #4.
